#  iOS Shortcuts Apps
A repository with different projects and tools built for the Shortcuts app on iOS.
# NOTICE
This repository will soon be taken down. This is because I have migrated to RoutineHub, as updates and general interface is better suited for this. I belive it will be better in the long run. You can find my RoutineHub account here below.

# About The Shortcuts App
The new "*Shortcuts*" app is an application for Apple's iPads, iPhones, or iPod touch devices. It allows you to build scripts to do diffrent tasks or functions.  It was previously known as the third-party app  "*WorkFlow*", before it was bought by Apple. With it now being a first-party app, it has much more capabilitys with greator system access. It was an app you could download thoughout iOS 12 fron the App Store, and is now a stock app pre-installed on iOS 13 and up.

# Just A Heads Up!
It is recommended that you use "*Shortcuts*" app instead of "*WorkFlow*". This is because "*WorkFlow*" might not be able to do some functions as it does not the high system access that "*Shortcuts*" has with it being a third-party app. The diffrent projects are in there own seperate forlders. The actual shortcuts links are in here as *.url* file. You can copy and paste the link in it into Safari. The other file, "*about.text*" is there explaining the basic functions of the shortcut.
